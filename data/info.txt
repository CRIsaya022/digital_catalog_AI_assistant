Introduction

Product Road Map Goal
Increase the value of the Biashara Plus app beyond the product price list.

What is Biashara Plus?
Biashara Plus is a mobile application that was developed specifically for Forever Living business owners (FBOs) to access and view the prices of Forever Living products. The app provides real-time access to product pricing as well as detailed product descriptions and images to help business owners make informed decisions.

Biashara Plus is currently available in nine countries across Eastern and Southern Africa, including Tanzania, Rwanda, Kenya, Burundi, Uganda, Zambia, Botswana, South Africa, and Namibia. Additionally, the app is expected to be launched soon in Ghana, extending its reach to Western Africa.

Biashara Plus Revenue
Biashara Plus offers two subscription packages: Eagle and Super Eagle. The Eagle Package is designed for Forever Living Business Owners (FBOs) who want to access the price list and process orders for their default country. On the other hand, the Super Eagle Package is ideal for FBOs who want to access the price list and process orders for multiple countries where Biashara Plus is available.
FBOs can choose to subscribe to either package for a duration of six or twelve months. "With either package, FBOs can manage their business more efficiently and improve their sales performance by accessing real-time pricing information and managing customer orders directly from their mobile device."

At present, we are collecting subscription fees from six countries, namely South Africa, Botswana, Zambia, Rwanda, Kenya, and Tanzania. Meanwhile, Biashara Plus is still available for free in other countries.

Currently, our Biashara has the capability of collecting a total of 10 million per quarter from Forever Living Business Owners (FBOs). This impressive figure includes subscriptions from only six out of the nine countries where the Biashara Plus app is currently available. It is clear that there is still a great deal of potential for growth and expansion in the remaining three countries, with more to come.
